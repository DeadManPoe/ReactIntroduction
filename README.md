# An introduction to React
When it comes to understand what is the purpose and utility of React, two things are key: abstraction and reactivity.

Abstraction is the idea of using strategies to describe and represent things that are best suitable for a specific purpose: if we are going to build a dynamic ui, we would want to use abstractions that put directly in front of the our eyes what's the shape of look of the ui, and how it is dynamic, i.e, how it changes w.r.t data.

Reactivity is the idea of responding automatically to a change occurred to something: if we are going to build a dynamic ui, an interesting, effective and natural approach would be to make it reactive w.r.t data, so that we don't have to manually update ui components when a change in some data happen.

Let's see how React is able to guarantee abstraction and reactivity, while vanilla JS is not.
